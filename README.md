Standing-Behind-Back
====================

**A Repast Simphony 2.1 simulation for an icebreaking game**

*There are bunch of people in a room. Everybody is invited to chose somebody else from this room (without telling to anyone). On a given mark, everybody tries to reach the chosen person and stand behand his/her back.*
